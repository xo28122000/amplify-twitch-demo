- explain the hooks directory 
- explain the hooks-config file 

- Scenario 1: amplify status - also run git status

add post-status.sh and write git status in the file and run:

amplify status

- Scenario 2: hooks on Amplify console

change file in React and run git push 
** the Amplify console will take about 10 mins to complete execution - come back here after Scenario 4 **

//
Amplify console will run the pre-push and post-push hooks
pre-push - checks for sensitive file (keys.json) in functions
post-push - sends a slack notification with the status of the build
//

- Scenario 3: 

amplify add function 
Lambda Function
testFunction
Node.js 
No
No

//
Runs post add function hook which deletes all .js files and creates .ts files insted and adds a tsconfig.json
//

- Scenario 4:

add keys.json in root of function directory and run:

amplify push 

//
Runs pre-push hook and determines there was a sensitive file(keys.json) and doesnt proceed forward the push execution
//

- cleanup: remove the funtion

amplify function remove 

** Complete to Scenario 2 **
